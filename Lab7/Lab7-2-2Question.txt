Questions:

Calculate the Need matrix:
     A  B  C
P0:  _  _  _
P1:  _  _  _
P2:  _  _  _
P3:  _  _  _
Is the system in a safe state? If yes, provide a safe sequence:
Your Answer: _______________________________________________
If P2 requests (0, 1, 1), should the request be granted?
Your Answer: _______________________________________________
Answer
1. Need Matrix:

     A  B  C
P0:  2  2  1
P1:  2  1  1
P2:  2  2  2
P3:  2  2  2
2. Safe State: Yes, safe sequence exists: P1 → P3 → P0 → P2

3. P2 request (0,1,1):

Check: (0,1,1) ≤ (2,2,2) ✓
Check: (0,1,1) ≤ (2,3,2) ✓
After allocation: Available = (2,2,1)
Safe sequence still exists: P1 → P3 → P2 → P0
Request should be GRANTED
